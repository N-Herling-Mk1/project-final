    "text": "This week we’re exploring water insecurity data featured in the article Mapping water insecurity in R with tidycensus!\n\nWater insecurity can be influenced by number of social vulnerability indicators—from demographic characteristics to living conditions and socioeconomic status —that vary spatially across the U.S. This blog shows how the tidycensus package for R can be used to access U.S. Census Bureau data, including the American Community Surveys, as featured in the “Unequal Access to Water” data visualization from the USGS Vizlab. It offers reproducible code examples demonstrating use of tidycensus for easy exploration and visualization of social vulnerability indicators in the Western U.S.\n\n\nHow does the lack of complete indoor plumbing compare between the 2023 and 2022 Census data?\nWhat counties have the greatest percent of households lacking plumbing?\nAre there differences in indoor plumbing availability between Western U.S and Eastern U.S counties?\n\nThank you to Niha Pereira for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-01-28')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 4)\n\nwater_insecurity_2022 &lt;- tuesdata$water_insecurity_2022\nwater_insecurity_2023 &lt;- tuesdata$water_insecurity_2023\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nwater_insecurity_2022 &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-28/water_insecurity_2022.csv')\nwater_insecurity_2023 &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-28/water_insecurity_2023.csv')\n\n# The geometry columns are saved as text with the code to reproduce them.\nwater_insecurity_2022 &lt;- water_insecurity_2022 |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    geometry = purrr::map(geometry, \\(geo) {\n      eval(parse(text = geo))\n    } )\n  )\nwater_insecurity_2023 &lt;- water_insecurity_2023 |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    geometry = purrr::map(geometry, \\(geo) {\n      eval(parse(text = geo))\n    } )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships.

    "text": "Why we chose this data-set:\nWe chose this dataset because water insecurity is a critical public health issue that may be influenced by various social vulnerability indicators. The data, sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS), provides county-level information on indoor plumbing insecurity for both 2022 and 2023. Since it covers multiple counties and spans two years, it is well-suited for analyzing year-over-year trends and regional disparities across the U.S. Additionally, the dataset is clean, complete, well-documented, and ideal for collaborative analysis and visualization."

How if at all did the change correlate to population change, geographical location, or total owner occupied households lacking plumbing facilities (as represented by the plumbing category)."

    "section": "Approach for question 1",
    "text": "Approach for question 1\n\nWe want to visualize which U.S. counties experienced the highest level of plumbing insecurity in 2022 and 2023. To represent the available data best, we will be creating bar graphs showing the top 10 counties with the highest percentages of households lacking complete indoor plumbing for each year. The comparison of the plot will be done for each individual year to highlight the most affected regions in the U.S.\nWe will clean the data using dplyr package by filtering and selecting the required variables for the analysis, including name, percent_lacking_plumbing, and year. We will sort the counties in descending order of percent_lacking_plumbing for each year. And the Top 10 counties for both 2022 and 2023 will be selected and combined into a single dataset for the visualization.\nTo visualize the results, we will use geom_col() from ggplot2 package to create bar graph, showing comparison between 2022 and 2023 using facet separation. These plots will allow us to address our first research question by identifying the top 10 counties with plumbing insecurity in the U.S and comparing the top-affected regions between 2022 and 2023."
